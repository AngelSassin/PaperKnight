Changes to make:

- Enemies spinning can cause small gameplay changes (Dung defender throwing backwards, etc.)
- Add spin on dream nail to NPCs
- Add missed NPCs to list (Junk Pit Godseeker variations, main GodSeeker dude, etc.)
- False Knight's head disappears on each hit
- On Knight death, the knight simply stands there and then vanishes once shade spawns ???
- When spinning False Knight, damage hitbox becomes weird
- Sprite Objects persist after loading a new scene. 
- Divine body disappears when leaving tent.
- Painting Nailsmith doesn't spin
- Flukenest, Weaverlings, and Grimmchild should cause spinning



Things to change or look for in P5:
- Some enemy corpses should still be spinnable before they explode or disappear. e.g. bosses like hornet, dung boi, moss charger, etc
- Lots of stuff in #general-voice-chat and Robot's video
