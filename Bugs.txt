Major Changes:
- SpriteObjects are now child objects of the original GameObject. Watch out for extra weirdness of sprites.
- Sprites will now mirror the animation of the original GameObject by setting the current clip and current frame.
- SpriteObjects of the original GameObject and its children all attempt to be visible when its mirror should be visible.
- Added some means to entirely stop spinning in any circumstance I want. Currently, this is only on False Knight's rage.

Bugs addressed:
- Knight warping into dream now shouldn't use glitchy sprite
- On Knight death, the knight no longer just stands there as the shade spawns
- NPCs now spin when struck with the dream nail
- Enemies spinning should no longer cause small gameplay changes (Dung defender throwing backwards, etc.) 
- Enemies should go invisible when appropriate
- Enemies and Knight now correctly use SpriteFlash
- Sprite Objects no longer persist after loading a new scene.
- Divine's body now spins, gives charms, and doesn't disappear when you leave the tent
- Grimm stagger bat doesn't spin
- Grimmchild doesn't disappear when fighting Grimm
- Grimm duplicates during his bow
- False Knight hitboxes are no longer weird
- False Knight's head now spins with the body
- False Knight's head no longer disappears on each hit
- Soul Master now vanish after dives 
- Elder Hu now vanish during his attack
- Greenpath Zote and Vengefly now spin

Things that may have changed but weren't specifically targeted:
- Some Godseeker variants do not spin in P5
- Ending cutscenes don't handle sprites correctly 









- Painting Nailsmith now spins


- Flukenest, Weaverlings, and Grimmchild now cause spinning
